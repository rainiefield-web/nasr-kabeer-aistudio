### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- Global primary aluminium production is forecast to increase to around 75.7 million tonnes in 2026, driven by new smelter capacity in Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa, despite a projected slowdown in global GDP growth.

- Global bauxite production is expected to cross 450 million tonnes in 2025 and continue to be supported into 2026 by sustained Chinese demand and strong export momentum from Guinea, which now supplies approximately 69% of global bauxite exports.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- High energy costs continue to threaten aluminum smelters in Europe and Australia, where power can account for up to 40% of total production costs, contributing to significant idle capacity in Europe following the energy crisis.

- Resource nationalism in West Africa, particularly Guinea, is impacting international aluminum producers' bauxite sourcing, with Guinea's plans to develop alumina capacity by 2030 potentially diverting bauxite from export markets and raising longer-term supply risks.
