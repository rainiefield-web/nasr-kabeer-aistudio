### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global aluminum market is projected to experience a notable deficit in 2026, with demand outstripping supply due to growth in green energy sectors and ongoing production constraints, suggesting sustained high and volatile prices.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's government-imposed cap on primary aluminum production, set at around 45 million metric tonnes, continues to be a key factor limiting global supply growth and supporting higher aluminum prices. [Source](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG8OQY1oViF7iMnb3wGfYmjloZurljQGaCOcNHKYVpB6QQ_X--M_paXx9obkNiqJwvdIRFH4F56chNKCFCAzqFVfRSP5X3Rx13aM6jfh9wSc2tvz_sgSH3ivX4KMk-rHuw8Z8puv_ZO2yHIpOTbY0J5EmZCGJRNOV5H4A==)
- High energy costs, particularly impacting regions outside China such as Europe and North America, continue to constrain primary aluminum smelter operations and keep significant production capacity offline.

- Indonesia is positioned to become a significant new source of aluminum supply, with several bauxite mining and smelter projects underway, though their full ramp-up is subject to infrastructure development and policy challenges.
