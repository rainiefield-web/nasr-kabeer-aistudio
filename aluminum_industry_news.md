### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global automotive aluminum plate market is projected to reach $30.52 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 12.6%, primarily driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) that require lightweight materials to improve range efficiency.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's bauxite supply is anticipated to shift from a tight balance in 2025 to a surplus in 2026, with prices potentially fluctuating around $70/mt, although Guinea's supply, which accounts for nearly half of China's total, remains susceptible to uncertainties like rainy seasons and strikes.

- JPMorgan forecasts a "first rising then falling" trend for aluminum prices in 2026, with an initial surge towards $3000/ton in Q1, followed by downward pressure in H2 due to the concentrated release of 4.25 million tons of new electrolytic aluminum production capacity from Indonesia.
