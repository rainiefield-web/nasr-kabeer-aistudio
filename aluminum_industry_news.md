### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Aluminum prices surged to a three-year high of $2,800 per tonne in October 2025, driven by rising supply concerns, increasing demand from clean energy sectors, limitations on China's smelting output due to power shortages, and new environmental regulations.

- Energy costs remain a primary driver of aluminum prices in 2026, with volatility in key smelting regions posing a threat of production curtailments if natural gas or coal prices spike during peak seasons.
