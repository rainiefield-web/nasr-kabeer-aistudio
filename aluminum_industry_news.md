*   **Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA):** EGA received a USD 4 billion grant for a primary aluminum smelter in Oklahoma, the first in the US in 45 years. EGA is expanding its aluminum recycling capacity in Germany, featuring advanced sorting systems.
*   **Rio Tinto:** Rio Tinto, a major owner of the Tomago smelter, has been in discussions with the Australian government to address rising energy costs.
*   **Norsk Hydro:** Norsk Hydro is a joint venture partner in Tomago Aluminium.

**Industry Trends and Analysis:**

*   **Global Supply Deficit:** The global primary aluminum market experienced a supply deficit of 108,700 mt in October 2025. From January to October 2025, the supply deficit was 955,500 mt.
*   **Alternative Supply Sources:** The aluminum industry is facing disruption as supply chains adapt to shifts in raw material availability and processing technologies. There's a strategic move towards diversified supply sources due to supply constraints and environmental pressures.
*   **European Market Decline:** Europe's aluminum industry is facing structural decline due to energy costs, technology, and trade tensions. Primary aluminum smelting capacity in Europe has fallen from 4.8 million tonnes annually in 2008 to roughly 2.9 million tonnes in 2025.
*   **Extrusion Market:** The global aluminum extrusion market is stabilizing in 2025, with usage expected to reach 35.25 million tonnes, a modest 2.8% increase from 2024. China accounts for approximately 65% of global usage.
