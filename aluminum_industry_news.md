### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global aluminum market is anticipated to remain in a deficit through 2026, primarily attributed to China's production capacity cap and ongoing power constraints impacting smelter operations outside of China.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Aluminum smelters are facing significant challenges from elevated electricity costs and intensifying competition for long-term power contracts, notably from emerging sectors like AI data centers that are willing to pay substantially higher prices.

- China's bauxite imports significantly increased by nearly 30% from January to November 2025, with Guinea as the primary supplier, underscoring China's efforts to secure raw materials, while Indonesia's bauxite production in 2026 will be tightly controlled under the RKAB framework to manage supply.
