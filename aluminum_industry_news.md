### Market Trends (from Gemini)

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Record bauxite shipments from Guinea to China in 2025 have led to an oversupply of the ore, subsequently depressing alumina prices and highlighting China's significant reliance on Guinean bauxite. [Source](https://www.alcircle.com/)
- Decarbonization efforts within the aluminum industry are estimated to require investments ranging from $500 billion to $1.5 trillion by 2050, primarily concentrated in China, which could slow new smelting capacity investments due to increased capital costs for renewable energy integration.
