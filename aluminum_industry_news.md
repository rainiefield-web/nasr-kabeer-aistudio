### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global automotive aluminum market is poised for significant growth, projected to expand from $31.91 billion in 2025 to $45.14 billion by 2031, driven primarily by the electrification of vehicles and the critical need for lightweighting to extend battery ranges.

- The primary aluminium market is anticipated to remain in a deficit throughout 2026, largely due to China's enforced capacity cap and persistent power constraints in other regions, which collectively limit supply expansion despite a gradual recovery in demand.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- The US aluminium market is facing distinct price spikes, with American buyers currently paying a 68% premium over LME prices for physical metal, a situation exacerbated by increased import tariffs and a domestic shortage of smelter capacity.

- The European Union's new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which commenced in January 2026, is leading to increased costs for higher-carbon aluminium imports and is influencing regional premiums.
