### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global aluminum market is projected to shift from a slight surplus in 2024 to a deficit of around 400,000-600,000 metric tons in 2025, driven by slowing production growth and gradual consumption recovery.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's primary aluminum production is nearing its government-imposed 45 million tonnes annual capacity cap, with current annualized rates around 43-44 million tonnes and operating rates exceeding 95%, limiting further growth.
