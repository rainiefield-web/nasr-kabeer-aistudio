### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- Global primary aluminium production is forecast to increase to around 73.9 million tonnes in 2025 and 75.7 million tonnes in 2026, with new smelter capacity emerging across Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa.

- Demand for aluminium is projected to rise by 40% by 2030, significantly driven by electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and lightweight construction, with EVs accounting for approximately 63% of new aluminium demand in transport.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's self-imposed annual production cap of 45 million tonnes for primary aluminium is a key constraint on global supply, with the cap expected to be breached in 2025, leading to output limitations in 2026. [Source](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGlj-XlnCkS34S2_csJs4wT04D-ZA_6r4eKUrjtA1SbOIABSLQwhkWJVU74lcOE0jal7f3VJq8NV1Ndd0nY7PQRQOQ-tFhcYwW6XbupbNWtVRnGA71nGUfz8TrIUuiB9hdLAyitCfYYgQB0xppN7l7_IWXMlATb)
- High energy costs continue to be a significant challenge for aluminium smelters, particularly in Europe and Australia, where electricity can represent up to 40% of total production costs, threatening operations and curtailing output.

- The implementation of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2026 is set to accelerate decarbonization efforts among high-emission aluminium producers and reshape trade dynamics, driving a premium for low-carbon materials.
