### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's primary aluminum output is nearing its self-imposed 45 million metric tonne annual capacity cap (reiterated in the 2025–2027 Action Plan), marking the end of a multi-decade expansion and limiting global supply growth.

- The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), effective in 2026, will tax imports based on embedded CO2, pressuring high-emission producers to decarbonize faster and increasing investment in low-carbon aluminum.
