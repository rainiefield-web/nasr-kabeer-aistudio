### Market Trends (from Gemini)

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Global aluminum prices surged to a three-year high of around $2,800 per tonne in October 2025, driven by heightened supply concerns, robust demand from clean energy sectors, and limitations on smelting output due to power shortages in China and new environmental regulations.

- The global aluminum market is projected to shift from a slight surplus in 2024 to a supply deficit of approximately 400,000-600,000 metric tons in 2025, influenced by slowing production growth and a gradual recovery in consumption.
