### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- LME aluminum prices experienced a volatile upward trend in 2025, reaching a three-year high, with expectations for continued volatility and a potential test of the USD 3,000/tonne threshold by early 2026 due to structural supply bottlenecks and policy uncertainty.

- The global aluminum market is projected to shift from a slight surplus in 2024 to a supply deficit in 2025, driven by China's capacity constraints and a gradual recovery in global demand.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), set to take effect in 2026, is expected to influence scrap supply, impose significant costs on importers, and intensify the focus on sustainability and low-carbon aluminum production.

- High European energy costs, particularly for electricity and natural gas, continue to significantly impact smelter operating rates and production costs, making European aluminum production less competitive globally.

- Disruptions in bauxite supply from major regions like Guinea and Brazil, coupled with new environmental regulations in China, are contributing to supply tightness for both bauxite and alumina.
