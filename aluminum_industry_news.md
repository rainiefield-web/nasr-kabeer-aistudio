### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- The implementation of U.S. aluminum tariffs, which doubled from 25% to 50% in 2025, has significantly reshaped global trade flows, leading Canadian aluminum smelters to redirect over 100,000 metric tons of metal from U.S. to European markets.

- Guinea's bauxite exports saw a substantial 23% surge in Q3 2025, reaching 39.41 million metric tonnes despite typical seasonal challenges, largely influenced by Chinese companies controlling over 54.6% of these exports to secure raw materials for their expanding aluminum production.
