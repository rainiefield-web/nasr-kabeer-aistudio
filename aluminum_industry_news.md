### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Electricity costs, constituting 30-50% of aluminum smelting expenses, are significantly impacting global smelter operations, with rising competition from AI data centers for power leading to smelter closures, not due to weak aluminum prices but increasingly unaffordable and scarce electricity.

- China's aluminum industry faces growing strategic vulnerabilities due to its heavy reliance on bauxite imports, which account for approximately 60% of its needs, mainly from Guinea and Australia, a dependency expected to intensify due to depleting domestic reserves and stricter environmental regulations.
