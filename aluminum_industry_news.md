### Industry & Corporate Insights (from Gemini)
- Alcoa Corporation reported strong fourth quarter and full-year 2025 results, with revenue increasing by 8 percent to $12.8 billion for the full year and setting annual production records at five aluminum smelters and one alumina refinery. For 2026, Alcoa expects aluminum segment production to range between 2.4 and 2.6 million metric tons, an increase from 2025 due to smelter restarts.

### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The primary aluminum market is expected to remain in a deficit through 2026, driven by less flexible supply, stricter environmental regulations, and China's primary aluminum capacity cap of around 45 million tonnes. [Source](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG_7kMT6tIvRvh6V2eRrtr6OXQfl4mehZ6rFdYpjBDD4Nr-TAfKzyHjbxVTD7Oi9F37PvqNyv5Fwyz8_9lkx7gLBmC2RgOs_IkkRkxZEjzcVuI2PuMCUQ6eSP5bSLd-JfFPZiQxxaAwJlJ0RJmR32zR2sMbSA7L5Q1JRx2p4OxcgHyGi7PomlZ0UraL29ah8UzJ7S2gi83qI7dtxyhMIOzUTfFi2THgU0Lw1JHIG3-JJkMC)
- Global aluminum prices are forecast to remain supported and potentially reach $3,000 per ton in 2026, partly due to production cuts in China and tariff barriers in Europe and North America.

- China's aluminum production reached a record 45.02 million tons in 2025, slightly exceeding its 45 million ton capacity cap, primarily driven by sustained demand from renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle manufacturing.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Aluminum smelters are increasingly competing with AI data centers for long-term power contracts, with technology companies willing to pay significantly higher prices, making it difficult for smelters to secure economically viable power. [Source](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFjvh_H5fKQ3_mwj7KJbyCMwld9Xrpw2DSPghPPzeASXXOrU5CQddrkYeOvF7aCTU3jcYDAL55fawfOfy8QDiYNdjrctjPDblz6Mm9POAYqs4Q5ch9kj9qnLK2N_86TXhJj34PJ__f-V2i03d2Sj9pP42_4sJPjXrKpjNC1c7cTCeDxbvzcqhM8)
- The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will fully take effect in 2026, introducing carbon-linked tariffs on imported products and altering the competitive landscape for aluminum exporters to the EU, intensifying scrutiny on the industry's ESG performance.
