### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global Green Aluminium Market is projected to reach USD 171.18 Billion in 2025 and USD 272.07 Billion by 2034, driven by increasing worldwide demand for sustainable materials to reduce carbon emissions in industries such as automotive, construction, and packaging.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- The bauxite investment landscape experienced renewed vigor in 2025, particularly in Australia and select emerging markets, driven by significant bauxite price increases following supply disruptions in Guinea and reduced Chinese production in late 2024.

- Persistently elevated electricity and natural gas prices in Europe are significantly impacting aluminium smelter operating rates and production costs, contributing to a volatile market outlook for LME aluminium prices in 2026.

- LME primary aluminium cash prices are expected to close 2025 around USD 2,800 per tonne, with forecasts suggesting further increases in 2026, potentially testing USD 3,000 per tonne, driven by tightening fundamentals, production caps, and supportive demand from electrification and infrastructure investment.
