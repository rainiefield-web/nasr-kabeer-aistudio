### Industry & Corporate Insights (from Gemini)

### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The 'all-in' price of aluminum in the US has surpassed $5,000 per ton, driven by substantial tariffs and an additional $560/ton premium for physical delivery, indicating a severe market shortage. [Source](https://www.alcircle.com/news/us-aluminium-prices-break-away-as-tariffs-collide-with-global-supply-strain-118835)
- European secondary aluminum prices are firming due to significant scrap shortages, a trend exacerbated by low generation and anticipated EU scrap export restrictions in Spring 2026.

- China's primary aluminum output reached record levels in 2025, slightly exceeding its self-imposed 45-million-ton production cap, while also increasing primary aluminum imports by 19% year-on-year in the first eleven months of 2025, largely from Russia.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Strong global demand growth, particularly from electric vehicles and grid expansion, is a key driver for higher aluminum prices, with EV production alone contributing a 15-20% annual increase in automotive consumption.

- Doubts surrounding the availability of power for new Indonesian smelters, coupled with higher energy costs and regulatory hurdles, are hindering China's expansion efforts and contributing to increased aluminum price forecasts. [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/aluminum)
