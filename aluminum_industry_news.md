### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- Analyst forecasts for the global aluminum market diverge for 2026, with ING predicting a continued deficit and average prices of $2,900/t, while Goldman Sachs projects a significant market surplus of 1.5-2 million tons, potentially leading to lower LME prices by Q4 2026.

- Southeast Asia's aluminum production is projected to surge by 40% annually, from 1.92 million tonnes in 2025 to 2.7 million tonnes by 2026, establishing the region as one of the fastest-growing production zones, driven by Indonesia's bauxite reserves and strategic investments.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Aluminum smelters globally face intense competition for long-term power contracts from AI data centers, which are willing to pay significantly higher prices (upwards of $115/MWh compared to the $40/MWh smelters need), hindering restarts of idle capacity in regions like Europe and the US.

- With China's aluminum output nearing its 45 million tonne capacity cap, Chinese firms are increasingly seeking to invest in aluminum projects abroad, particularly in Indonesia, influencing global supply dynamics.

- Global automotive production is forecast to contract in 2025 and 2026, mainly due to US tariffs on automotive imports and weaker economic growth, despite the continued long-term trend of increasing aluminum usage for lightweighting in electric vehicles.
