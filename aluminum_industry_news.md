### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- China's adherence to its 45 million-ton annual aluminum production cap in 2025 led to domestic smelters halting expansion plans, impacting global supply dynamics and pricing by redirecting inventory to the local market.

- Guinea's bauxite exports surged by 25% in 2025 to 182.8 million metric tons, with a record 74% destined for China, cementing Guinea's role as a major bauxite supplier, but also contributing to a significant drop in Shanghai alumina prices.

- High electricity costs, constituting 25-35% of primary aluminum production expenses, expose the industry to significant vulnerability from energy price fluctuations, prompting some smelters to temporarily cut production.
