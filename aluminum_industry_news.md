### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- US aluminum consumers are paying a substantial 68% premium over the London Metal Exchange (LME) price for physical metal, largely due to import tariffs that have suppressed supply and limited domestic primary aluminum production growth. [Source](https://www.mining.com/column-us-aluminum-consumers-pay-the-spiraling-cost-of-tariffs/)
- China's aluminum output reached a record 45.02 million tons in 2025, effectively nearing its government-imposed capacity cap, which limits the country's ability to significantly increase global supply further despite rising demand from renewable energy and EVs. [Source](https://www.discoveryalert.com/chinas-aluminium-production-soars-to-record-45-02-million-tonnes/)
- Outside of China, power availability and high energy costs are limiting new smelter capacity investments and restarts, as aluminum smelters now compete with energy-intensive AI data centers for long-term power contracts.
