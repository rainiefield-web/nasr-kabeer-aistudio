### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- World primary aluminium production growth slowed to a five-year low in 2025, attributed to weaker output from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and China nearing its 45-million-tonne production cap. [Source](https://alcircle.com/news/aluminium-industries-latest-news-117578)

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Global aluminum supply is constrained by China's production cap, international trade restrictions (such as US tariffs), and operational disruptions at smelters in regions like Iceland, Mozambique, and Australia due to prolonged energy crises.

- US physical aluminum prices are trading at a 68% premium over LME prices, with total prices exceeding $5,000 per tonne, driven by increasing import tariffs and a significant drop in domestic inventories from 750,000 tonnes to under 300,000 tonnes in 2025.
