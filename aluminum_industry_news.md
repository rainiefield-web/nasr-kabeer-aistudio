### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Global bauxite production growth is expected to slow to 2% in 2025, reaching 451.3 million tonnes, primarily due to weaker data from Mainland China and escalating political and regulatory risks in Guinea, a key supplier. [Source](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/global-bauxite-production-outlook-lowered-for-2025-2025-11-28)
- Aluminium smelters in the US, Europe, and Africa are encountering difficulties in securing long-term power contracts, impacting new supply, with instances like Century Aluminium in Iceland facing partial shutdowns and Mozal smelter in Mozambique being placed under care and maintenance. [Source](https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/aluminium-prices-ending-2025-at-its-highs-more-steam-left-18635848.htm)
- Tariff policies and China's capacity constraints are expected to be main forces pushing global aluminum prices higher in the second half of 2025, even as LME inventories increased in July 2025, suggesting complex market dynamics beyond simple supply/demand.
