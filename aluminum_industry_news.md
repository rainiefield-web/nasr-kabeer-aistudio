### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global aluminum market is projected to grow from US$280 billion in 2025 to US$500 billion by 2032, exhibiting an 8.6% CAGR, driven by increasing demand from the automotive, aerospace, and construction sectors, and a shift towards secondary aluminum.

- An increasing emphasis on recycling is a crucial trend in the aluminum market, as it requires only about 5% of the energy needed for primary aluminum production, aligning with global sustainability goals and reducing carbon footprints.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Alumina prices rallied throughout 2024, reaching record highs, but declined in 2025 due to excess supply and muted consumer demand, easing concerns over bauxite supply, as reported by Fastmarkets.

- Trade conflicts and increasing demand from the automotive and packaging industries are projected to cause significant volatility in aluminum supply chains and price controls for the remainder of the decade.
