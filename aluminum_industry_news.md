### Market Trends (from Gemini)
- The global automotive aluminum market is projected to reach US$ 205.24 billion by 2032, growing with a CAGR of 9.7% from 2025, driven primarily by increasing demand for lightweight materials in electric vehicles (EVs) and stricter fuel efficiency regulations.

- The global aluminum market is expected to shift from a slight surplus in 2024 to a supply deficit of approximately 400,000 to 600,000 metric tons in 2025, primarily attributed to slowing production growth and a gradual recovery in consumption.

### Strategic Factors (from Gemini)
- Alumina supply is expected to recover and create a surplus in 2025 due to new capacity additions in Indonesia and India, potentially easing pressure on aluminum operating costs after record-high prices in 2024.

- Increased US import tariffs on aluminum, raised to 50% from June 2025, are significantly pushing up domestic prices with the Midwest premium reaching record highs, but some industry sources worry this could eventually weaken demand.

- China's domestic aluminum production is nearing its regulatory ceiling of 45 million metric tons, which, alongside limited commissioning of new projects, will result in slow growth in global aluminum production in 2025 and an increased pull for ex-China refined units.
